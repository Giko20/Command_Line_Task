# Command_Line_Task

Create a command-line tool that allows the user to search for and view information from a database using SQL commands. 
The tool should have the following features:

The user should be able to connect to a SQL database using the command line.
The user should be able to execute SQL queries to search the database for specific information.
The tool should be able to output the results of the query to the command line in a formatted way that is easy for the user to read.
The user should be able to save the results of a query to a file.
The tool should have an option to execute Python scripts that can manipulate the data returned by the SQL query.
The user should be able to navigate the file system using Linux commands and execute scripts in Python.

To implement this project, you can use Python libraries such as sqlite3 for connecting to the database and executing queries, 
os for navigating the file system, and subprocess for executing Python scripts from the command line. 
You will also need to have a database set up with data to search through.

Here are some steps you can take to get started:

Set up a SQLite database with some sample data to search through.
Write a Python script that connects to the database and allows the user to execute SQL queries through the command line.
Use Python's os library to allow the user to navigate the file system using Linux commands.
Use Python's subprocess library to allow the user to execute Python scripts from the command line.
Add the ability to save query results to a file.
Add the ability to execute Python scripts that manipulate the data returned by the SQL query.
